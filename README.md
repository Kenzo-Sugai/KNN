# KNN - Kenzo's Neural Network

## Description ðŸ“‹

I made this neural network using C++ vanilla. The only external library used is Eigen, which is a linear algebra library.

I used KNN to run a dataset named Iris. Upon running the neural network, KNN logs a final prediction error ranging from 1% to 2% for the flowers.

## How to run ðŸ’»

1. Download repository or getclone in your directory.
2. Install [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/GettingStarted.html) and configure your compiler.
3. Run file main.cpp using your C++ Compiler.
4. If you want, run plot.py to generate a graph depicting the error of KNN.
5. Enjoy using KNN by incorporating Network.hpp into your code.
