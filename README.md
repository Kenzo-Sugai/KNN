# KNN - Kenzo's Neural Network

## Description

I made this neural network using C++ vanilla. The only external library used is Eigen, which is a linear algebra library.

I used KNN to run a dataset named Iris. This dataset shows some information about flowers in general. If you run the neural network, KNN shows a log with 1% to 2% of the flower's prediction error.

## How to run
